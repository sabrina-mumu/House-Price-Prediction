# House Price Prediction

This is a project to predict the price of a house based on various features. **Linear Regression** , **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, **Support Vector**, and **Gradiant Boosting** models are used.

Besides, I have implemented a **Grid search** Method for the Random Forest Regressor model to compare the results.

An **analysis of the dataset** is also given here.

The main steps of the Project are:

1. Dataset Download
2. Reading and Cleaning Data
3. Feature Engineering
4. Analyzing Data
5. Pre-processing
6. Applying Machine Learning models
7. Applying Grid search
